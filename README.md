#Instances translator
This projects aims to make it easy to translate VRP instances to the VRP-REP unified format, based on XML.

For the moment, the translator converts most of TSPLIB95 files, using conventions as described in [the official document](http://www.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/groups/comopt/software/TSPLIB95/DOC.PS).
